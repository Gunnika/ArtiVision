# ArtiVision

A smart eye-wear system with 'human-like' capabilities for visually impaired people. 
It helps visually impaired & blind people read by scanning documents, identifying the text & converting it into speech. 

It can be used for the blind students to know the contents of the question paper in examination halls when the exam is not in braille code and thus removes the necessity of helper and make them independent.
